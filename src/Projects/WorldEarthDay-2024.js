                                            As we mark Earth Day 2024, the global theme "Planet vs. Plastics" starkly reminds us of the urgent need to address the environmental and health crises posed by plastic pollution. This year, Earth Day is about celebrating our planet and taking decisive steps to protect it from plastics' devastating impacts.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Plastics have become an integral part of our daily lives, but their production and disposal have escalated to alarming levels. According to EARTHDAY.ORG, plastic production has surged to more than 380 million tons annually, surpassing the entire 20th century's output in just the last decade. This rapid expansion is fueled by petrochemical industries known for their toxic emissions, spills, and explosions, often located in the poorest corners of the earth. The consequences of these industries are far-reaching, affecting not only the environment but also human health.
