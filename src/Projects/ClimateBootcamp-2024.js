This event aimed to inspire and equip young environmental leaders with practical knowledge and skills to drive environmental actions. The bootcamp empowered students to participate actively in environmental conservation and sustainable development.

They showcased innovative projects, from plastic waste management to rainwater harvesting, demonstrating their commitment to practical solutions for local environmental challenges.
