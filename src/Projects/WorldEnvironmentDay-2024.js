                                            As we mark the World Environment Day today, June 5th, 2024, the focus is on the critical issues of land restoration, desertification, and drought. These challenges haven proven not to be just environmental concerns; they are existential threats that demand immediate attention and action. At Green Environment and Climate Change Initiative - GECCI , we believe in the power of collective action to protect and restore our planet for future generations.   
                                        </p>

                                            During the event, students showcased their innovative crafts, created through our engagement with them. They transformed PET bottles into hanging gardens, demonstrating creativity and environmental stewardship. These upcycled gardens not only added greenery but also highlighted practical ways to reuse plastic waste. Additionally, students converted plastic plates into functional lights, merging sustainability with utility. These projects exemplified the students' ingenuity and commitment to addressing environmental challenges throughÂ upcycling.
