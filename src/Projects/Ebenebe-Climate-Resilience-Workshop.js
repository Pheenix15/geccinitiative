                                        <p>
                                        Green Environment and Climate Change Initiative (GRENCHI), with the unwavering support of the Nigeria Climate Justice Alliance (NCJA), Nigeria Conservation Foundation (NCF), and in partnership with the Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Ministry of Environment, Anambra State, is making a lasting impact in the heart of Ebenebe. 
                                        Climate change introduces severe negative impacts, and sadly, communities and indigenous people who contribute little to nothing to climate change face the brunt of these impacts as they are the most affected by climate change. Additionally, they most times lack the necessary resource and information for both adaptation, and resilience.
                                        Our recent one-day workshop was a vital step in addressing and enhancing the climate resilience of the Ebenebe agrarian community in Anambra State, Nigeria.

                                        <span>So, what is so beautiful about Ebenebe, Anambra State?</span>
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Nestled in Anambra State, Ebenebe boasts of a massive forest land mass, a precious natural resource now at risk due to a spike in deforestation. With approximately 75 percent of the population engaged in farming, the community, despite contributing minimally to climate change, bears the brunt of its direct impacts on agriculture.

                                        On 16th of January 2024, at Umuejinwoke Kindred Hall, Umuoji, Ebenebe, Anambra State, the Green Environment and Climate Change Initiative hosted a workshop with the theme: "Building Climate Resilience of Ebenebe Agrarian Community." This workshop culminates an outstanding engagement of 80 stakeholders, including community members, local authorities, farmers, market women, community leaders, foresters, and environmental enthusiasts.
                                        The agenda of the workshop included a comprehensive range of topics, including sustainable agriculture practices, climate resilience strategies, effects of climate change, and community-based adaptation strategies.
                                        The organization utilized the power of language to communicate an understanding of climate change, and resilience to the community by holding the workshop in the native language of the Ebenebe people, Igbo language, and making interpretations where necessary.
