                                            On the 9th and 10th of February 2024, we hosted the first ever Youth Climate Policy Training (YCPT) in Anambra State, Nigeria with target towards empowering Nigerian youths with the knowledge and understanding of Nigerians Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs), Climate Change Act and National Forest Policy.

                                            <br />
                                            Over the course of two days, participants engaged in interactive workshops, expert-led discussions, and hands-on activities aimed at deepening their understanding of climate policy and empowering them to drive meaningful change in their communities.
                                            The program received more than 200 applications and out of this pool of applications, 21 outstanding individuals were selected for the training. The diversity of this training was evidently shown in the mix of participants present. The training comprised youths from different parts of Nigeria including Bauchi, Niger, Plateau, Oyo, Enugu, Anambra and Imo state.
